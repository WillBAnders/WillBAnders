Hi there, I'm Blake Anderson. I'm a Master's student in computer science at the
University of Florida and founder of the [Society of Software Developers](https://ufssd.org).
I research programming languages and have my own language [Rhovas](https://rhovas.dev),
and also do a lot of work with Minecraft development through [Sponge](https://spongepowered.org)
as well.

 - [Rhovas](https://github.com/Rhovas), a programming language for API design
   and enforcement focusing on design by contract, error handling with both
   exceptions and result types, and object mutability. Rhovas is now on it's
   third year, and might very well become my life's work!
 - [CrateCrate](https://github.com/flash-labs/CrateCrate), a Sponge plugin for
   loot crates. I've been designing this plugin for close to a year and a half
   now, and the configuration system is one of the most elegantly complex
   monstrosities I think I've ever created (it works though!).
 - [My Blog](https://blog.willbanders.dev), a blog on programming language
   design and other tech areas that catch my attention. Some recent articles:
    - [Introducing Syntax Macros](https://blog.willbanders.dev/articles/introducing-syntax-macros.html),
      a new method for implementing Embedded DSLs (Domain-Specific Languages)
      based on macros that was the topic of my [Honors Thesis](https://ufdc.ufl.edu/AA00082326/00001/citation).
    - [A Case for Properties](https://blog.willbanders.dev/articles/a-case-for-properties.html),
      an overview of properties in programming languages, why you should use
      them, and some proposed guidelines to minimize the issue of arbitrary
      computation. Front page of [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25102163)!

For me, open source work is almost a second job - I spend about 20-30 hours a
week working on projects or providing support, all of which is free. I don't
restrict features or support behind paywalls; I do what I do because I want to
see others use what I've spent so much of my time to create. If you are
